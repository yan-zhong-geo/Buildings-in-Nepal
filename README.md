This repository contains a curated dataset of building footprints within Nepal, compiled from multiple open data sources. The dataset is intended for research, analysis of infrastructure, hazard exposure studies, and other geospatial applications.

## Dataset Overview

- **Coverage**: Entire territory of Nepal (official Nepal border)
- **Data Type**: Vector data (building footprints, polygons or points)  
- **Coordinate Reference System**: WGS 84 (EPSG:4326)  


The building data has been extracted and compiled from various open datasets, including:

| Data Source | Data Type in Here | Approx. Number of Buildings | Data name in Here | Data Quality / Notes | Original data source |
|------------|-----------|---------|--------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------|
| OpenStreetMap (OSM) | Polygon | 8 million | OSM_Nepal.gpkg | Generally accurate; urban areas more complete; may miss some rural buildings | [OpenStreetMap Data Extracts](https://download.geofabrik.de/)
| GlobalBuildingAtlas (GBA) | Point | 12 million | GBA_nepal_buildings.gpkg | The data is the most accurate, but due to satellite image quality issues, there are extensive data gaps across the entire region | [mediaTUM](https://mediatum.ub.tum.de/1782307)
| Google Open Building | Polygon / Point | X,XXX | X,XXX | X,XXX | X,XXX
